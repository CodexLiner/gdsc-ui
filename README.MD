# Problem Statement
As in daily life we do countless transactions in both mode online as well as with cash, so making a record of our daily expenses with pen and paper might get more hectic and we might not be able to remember every transaction of our daily life.
# Proposed Solution with screenshots
We have created an application in which users can set their own budget to make track of their expenses, in this application we can add our transactions the time we do and it doesn't require any internet connection, it stores the data in your mobile phone. And also provide a beautiful progress bar for the analysis of our expenses.

We can add functionality to set multiple budget types so that we can differentiate different budgets in different scenarios
